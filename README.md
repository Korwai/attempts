If there's ever a concept of programming I want to learn, I'll do my practice/tinkering of it here.

pokemon: My first encounter with Maven and .json files. I attempt to deserialize/unmarshall a .json file full of pokemon.
TicTacToe: First attempt at recreating TicTacToe from the console. This is to help prepare for a future side project.
